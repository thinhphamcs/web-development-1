			<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
			
			<img src="ms_euler.png" alt="Euler's Face"/>
			
			<p>
			The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
			<strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
			he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean 
			Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
			and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
			Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
			publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His 
			influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
			</p>

			<p>
			He is perhaps best known for his research into 
			mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
			<cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, 
			remained a standard textbook in the field for 
			well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
			he wrote 
			<cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, 
			giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
			physical theories of the time.
			</p>

			<p>
			One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
			copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
			as <var>e</var> and <var>&pi;</var>, were introduced 
			in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
			leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
			certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.

			<h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

			<p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:</p>

			<code>
				cos(<var>x</var>)+<var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>)=<var>e</var><sup><var>xi</var></sup>
			</code>

			<p>
			which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
			complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
			equation, it's easy to derive the identity:
			</p>

			<code>
				<var>e</var><sup><var>&pi;</var><var>i</var></sup>+1=0
			</code>

			<p>
			which relates the fundamental constants: 
			0, 1, <var>&pi;</var>, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and 
			elegant statement. A poll of readers 
			conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer<cite>
			magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
			most beautiful theorem in the history of 
			mathematics.
